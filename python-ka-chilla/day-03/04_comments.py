# We have to start a notebook from comments (always) to tell about notebook
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------/
# Professional Way:
# Subject of this python script:
# Authored by : MUHAMMAD IDREES
# Where to contact : GitHub profile link "OR" email

# And then write Step wise everything

# Step-01 : Why to use single quotation?
print('MUHAMMAD')           # When we are writing a string
print("What's up")

# Step-02: When to use "" double quotation marks?
print("MUHAMMAD IDREES")    # When we are writing a strings and making use of other quotation marks 
print("What's up")

# Step-03: When to use ''' tripple quotation marks?
print('''
Tufail
Aammar.
And
MUHAMMAD
IDREES
''')                        # To write multiline string and also using """ or '' quotation marks inside as write below.

print('''
This is
Another
Multi-line
comments
in which we can
use double quotation like "Muhammad Idrees's" Current role
''')

# Assignment: When to use comments in python? Mention 10 study cases!
# Solution:
1. # Use in the start to tell about a notebook or it describing the purpose of a script or function
# i.e:  This script calculates the factorial of a number using recursion

2. # Explaining complex logic
# i.e:  Using memorization to improve the efficiency of Fibonacci calculation

3. # Clarifying tricky parts of code
# i.e:  if user input is not a digit, return an error
# user_input = input("Enter a number")
# if not user_input.isdigit():
#     return "Invailde input"

4. # Making TODOs or Future improvements
# TODO: Optimize this loop using list comprehension

5. # Temporarily disabling code for debugging
# print("This is a test print for debugger")

6. # Explaining why a certain (specific) approach is used
# Using while loop instead of for loop to handle dynamic list length

7. # Highlighting assumptions
# Assuming input list contains only integers

8. # Providing sample input/output for functions
# Example: reverse_string("Hello") -> "Olleh"

9. # Documenting version changes or updates
# v1.2 - Updated the login validation to include email regex

10. # Warnings about limitations or edge cases
# NOTE: This function doesn't handle leap years
